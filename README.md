# Things I've Learned
* Single Responsibility Principle: only has one focus what to do, but doesn't mean only may have one method.
* Open-Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification, meaning the mod doesn't take a big effort to do it.
* Liskov Substitution: when the object changed, it shouldn't break any code because it conforms the same subclass.
* Interface Segregation: separate interface into different protocol for each interface's tasks.
* Dependency Inversion: high-level business rules do not depend on mid or low level implementation.
